# Software Carpentry Git lesson discussion
Part of the instructor training.

## Questions upfront
* how to start with a clean env? (alias/config)
* when to do the install of Git / nano?
* how to introduce version control / Git?
* how to introduce concepts like the staging area?

## Notes
* installation is done upfront; workshop starts 30minutes earlier to solve install problems
* maybe create a new user to avoid config/aliases (probably rather replace .gitconfig, as I need 1Password for GitHub)
* do not mention branches, even in case of detached head. Just ``git checkout master``
* copy config commands into etherpad to avoid mistakes
* make sure students are in the right folder before running ``git init``
* remind people to choose a GitHub password they can remember
